# ₿ FreeWithBTC - Bitcoin Life Improvement Calculator

**"Your life gets better on a Bitcoin standard"** 

A Bitcoin life improvement calculator that proves mathematically why life gets better on a Bitcoin standard through three fundamental pillars.

## 🚀 Three Pillars Framework

### 1. 📚 "There Is No Second Best" 
**Education & Proof** - Counter the "Bitcoin isn't enough" narrative with data and education
- Bitcoin vs. other assets over time (stocks, gold, fiat currencies)
- Why Bitcoin's monetary properties are unique
- Risk comparison: Bitcoin self-custody vs. yield products

### 2. 💰 "Life Gets Cheaper and Better"
**Purchasing Power Calculator** - Show the deflationary benefit of living on a Bitcoin standard
- Current monthly expenses → Future Bitcoin cost reduction
- "Your $4,000/month expenses cost only $544/month in 10 years" (86.4% reduction)
- Quality of life improvements from deflationary money

### 3. 🚀 "Escape the Rat Race"
**Financial Freedom Timeline** - Show the mathematical path to work-optional life
- Years until financially free (expenses covered by Bitcoin appreciation)
- "Quit your job" calculator based on living expenses
- Freedom timeline with different stacking rates

## 🎯 User Profiles

### New Stacker (Primary Target)
- **Bitcoin Holdings**: 0.1 BTC 
- **Monthly DCA**: $500
- **Monthly Expenses**: $4,000
- **Use Case**: Needs conviction building and education

### Old Stacker (Secondary Target)
- **Bitcoin Holdings**: 1 BTC
- **Monthly DCA**: $1,000  
- **Monthly Expenses**: $6,000
- **Use Case**: Wants optimization and advanced features

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit (modern web UI)
- **Charts**: Plotly (interactive visualizations)
- **Data**: Pandas + NumPy + Session State
- **Storage**: Session-based isolation (privacy-first, no database)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nostrgamer/FreeWithBTC.git
cd FreeWithBTC

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Live Demo

## 📱 Features

### ✅ What We ARE:
- Bitcoin life improvement education platform
- Mathematical proof of Bitcoin-only strategy  
- Purchasing power and freedom calculator
- Counter-narrative to "Bitcoin isn't enough" FUD
